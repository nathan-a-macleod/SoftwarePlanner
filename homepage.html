      <h1>What is ‘Software Planner’ and why should you use it?</h1>
      <br />
      <p>Software Planner is a new, FREE tool that is used for designing, organising and planning software projects. It is primarily aimed at software developers and programmers, but is useful to many different situations.
      <br /><br />
      <p>Some of the things that make it suited to developers and programmers include being able to create diagrams, charts and graphs for your software. It is very easy, intuitive and exciting to use.</p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>We hope to make this the only tool you will need to use for your projects.</p>
