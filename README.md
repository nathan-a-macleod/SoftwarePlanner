# SoftwarePlanner

# BASIC IDEA:
A website used for designing, organising and planning software projects - aimed at software developers and programmers - allowing the user to easily and painlessly plan, design, organise and prioritize the creation of software so that they can relax, and begin to focus on the actual programming part of the project.
It’s unique because this will have the ability to do things that other websites can’t do like drawing mockups for the UI of software.

# GOALS:
# 1. Create a prototype for the website using something like an exportable link, or a png image file.

  a. Begin with a homepage that people will see when they look at the site.
  
  b. Next, design what the actual function page will look like. (The page where they can do everything like planning and     organising software).
   
# 2. Begin programming the site with HTML, CSS and javascript.

# 3. Make sure it is fully responsive.

  a. Make sure it works with all different types of screen sizes, browsers, etc.
