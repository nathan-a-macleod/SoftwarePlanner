### SoftwarePlanner (REALLY need to change the name at some point!)

# Basic idea:
A website used for designing, organising and planning software projects - aimed at software developers and programmers - allowing the user to easily and painlessly plan, design, organise and prioritize the creation of software so that they can relax, and begin to focus on the actual programming part of the project.

It’s unique because this will have the ability to do things that other websites can’t do like drawing mockups for the UI of software, creating things like graphs, charts and diagrams.

# How to use:
It's very simple: Download the project (clone it), unzip it, and open the 'index.html' file in your browser!
